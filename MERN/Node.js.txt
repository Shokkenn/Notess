Node.js :-

       Node.js is a single threadrd non-blocking runtime environment for executing javascript code outside of the browser.
       
       Chrome uses V8 engine runtime.

       Node.js is built on V8 engine.

       Easy, Fast and scalable network application.

       But not good for CPU intensive application.


       npm init : creates package.json (asks projects details etc.)
